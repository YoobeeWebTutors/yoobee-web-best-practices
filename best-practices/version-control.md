# Version Control Best Practices

When using version control for a web project at Yoobee School of Design, you should:

* Back up elsewhere (especially when getting started with Git)
* Avoid working directly on the master branch. Use a separate branch called “dev” for merging features and bug fixes into. When the dev branch is fully tested and stable, it can be merged into the master branch.
* Make commits of small logical complete units
* Commit early and often, perfect later, publish once
* Write good commit messages
* Test thoroughly before committing
* Use a branching strategy to prevent mixing up different lines of development
* Follow a style guide of an existing project or create one for a new project
* Review the CONTRIBUTING.MD file associated with an existing project or create one for a new project
* Look at existing pull requests and issues to make sure that you aren’t duplicating effort
 
## Collaborative version control
* Agree on workflow
* Keep to your own unit of work
* Decide who is allowed to publish to the master repository
* Use a branching strategy to prevent mixing up different lines of development
* Keep to a naming convention for branches. For example: “name/feature/short-description” would be a naming convention for a following branch called “bob/contact-us/contact-form”
* Engage in peer review for prospective changes
* Consider using a pull request template
