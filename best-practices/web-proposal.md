# Web Proposal Best Practices

* Show name of project, project commencement and projected completion date and both the client’s and author’s contact details on the cover page
* Ensure document is free of spelling or grammar mistakes
* Describe functionality and structure clearly through diagrams
* Be explicit when showing concept development
* Favour visualisation tools (diagrams, charts, mock-ups, etc) over text. Avoid walls of text
* Include all necessary components from the Yoobee Web Proposal Guide

## Client documentation

* Deliver in pdf format on A4 letterhead
* Ensure documentation is presented professionally to a standard that could be shown to a client
* Keep the language to a technical level suitable for the client
* Ensure planning is complete and proposal is signed off by client prior to development

## Internal documentation
* Keep the language to a technical level suitable for your team members
