# Unified Modeling Language (UML) Best Practices

When creating UML diagrams in the planning stage for a web project at Yoobee School of Design, you should:

* aim to provide structure for problem solving
* choose appropriate diagrams and elements
* keep diagrams relevant and leave out trivial details
* ensure your UML diagram is easily understandable. If a diagram becomes large or overly complex, see if it can be simplified or broken into separate diagrams
* get feedback from your teammates and tutor and make required changes to the UML design before development
* adhere to UML modelling naming conventions
* maintain a consistent and symmetrical layout
* always give headings to your diagrams
* avoid crossing lines 
* use online diagramming software
