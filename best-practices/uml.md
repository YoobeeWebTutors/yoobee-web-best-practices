# Unified Modeling Language (UML) Best Practices

When creating UML diagrams in the planning stage for a web project at Yoobee School of Design, you should:

* Aim to provide structure for problem solving
* Choose appropriate diagrams and elements
* Keep diagrams relevant and leave out trivial details
* Ensure your UML diagram is easily understandable. If a diagram becomes large or overly complex, see if it can be simplified or broken into separate diagrams
* Get feedback from your teammates and tutor and make required changes to the UML design before development
* Adhere to UML modelling naming conventions
* Maintain a consistent and symmetrical layout
* Always give headings to your diagrams
* Avoid crossing lines 
* Use online diagramming software
