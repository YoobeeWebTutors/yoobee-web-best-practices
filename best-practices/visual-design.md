# Visual Design Best Practices

* Create a clear visual hierarchy
* Define functional regions of a page
* Group page elements that are related so you can see structure in the content
* Keep a consistent design approach to build rhythm and unity
* Remember contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity (C.R.A.P)
* Be details-focussed with high fidelity mockups using a “pixel-perfect” approach
* Use images that create a mood
* Consider building page elements around imagery
* Take advantage of the psychological impact of color in design and consider appropriate colour combinations
* Use a variation of design techniques (such as layout options, patterns, textures, etc) if your design is too one-dimensional
