# Treaty of Waitangi Best Practices

When planning and producing a web project at Yoobee School of Design, you should:

* Consider promotion of the Maori language and culture through inclusion
* Incorporate aspects of te ao Māori (the Maori World)
* Ensure Tikanga Māori (the Maori “way”) is valued and promoted
* Provide opportunities for users to read and use te reo Māori (the Maori language) 
* Where possible, consult the Māori community and call on their expertise to provide advice and guidance
* Endeavour to ensure Māori are well represented in your design
* Give particular consideration to the three principles of the Treaty of Waitangi - partnership, participation and protection
